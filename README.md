Figuring out how to implement your ML project? Learn from **How other organizations have done it in past?**:
- **How** problem is framed üîé(e.g., personalization as recsys vs. search vs. sequences)
- **What** machine learning techniques worked ‚úÖ (and sometimes, what didn't ‚ùå)
- **Why** it works, the science behind it with research, literature, and references üìÇ
- **What** real-world results were achieved (so you can better assess ROI ‚è∞üí∞üìà)
