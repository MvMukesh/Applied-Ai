Figuring out how to implement your ML project? Learn from **How other organizations have done it in past?**:
- **How** problem is framed 🔎(e.g., personalization as recsys vs. search vs. sequences)
- **What** machine learning techniques worked ✅ (and sometimes, what didn't ❌)
- **Why** it works, the science behind it with research, literature, and references 📂
- **What** real-world results were achieved (so you can better assess ROI ⏰💰📈)
